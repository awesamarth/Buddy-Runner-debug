# 🎮 Buddy's On-Chain Adventure - Blockchain Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy and configure the smart contract for Buddy's game to work fully on-chain with MegaETH and other supported networks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your game is now configured to work with the following high-speed testnets:
- **MegaETH Testnet** ⚡ (Chain ID: 12227332) - 100,000 TPS
- **Base Sepolia** 🔵 (Chain ID: 84532) 
- **Monad Testnet** 🟣 (Chain ID: 41454)

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Wallet with testnet ETH** - You'll need testnet funds for each network
2. **Solidity compiler** - For deploying the smart contract
3. **Contract deployment tool** - Hardhat, Remix, or similar

## 🔗 Contract Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy the Smart Contract

The `BuddyGame.sol` contract is located in `/src/contracts/`. Deploy it to your preferred networks:

```solidity
// Contract handles:
// - Game session management
// - Movement tracking (each jump = transaction)
// - On-chain scoring
// - High score persistence
```

### Step 2: Update Contract Addresses

After deployment, update the contract addresses in `/src/services/blockchainService.js`:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  12227332: "YOUR_MEGAETH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",    // MegaETH Testnet
  84532: "YOUR_BASE_SEPOLIA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS", // Base Sepolia
  41454: "YOUR_MONAD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"         // Monad Testnet
};
```

### Step 3: Get Testnet Funds

- **MegaETH**: Visit the faucet (check MegaETH docs)
- **Base Sepolia**: Use Base faucet or bridge from Ethereum Sepolia
- **Monad**: Visit Monad testnet faucet

## 🎯 How the On-Chain Game Works

### Movement Transactions
Every time Buddy jumps, a transaction is sent to the blockchain:
- **Function**: `makeMovement()`
- **Gas Cost**: Optimized for minimal gas usage
- **Queue System**: Max 2 pending transactions (like Crossy Fluffle)

### Scoring System
- **Local Score**: Continues running for smooth gameplay
- **On-Chain Score**: Updated with each movement transaction
- **High Scores**: Permanently stored on blockchain

### Real-Time Experience
The game is designed to showcase the speed difference between networks:
- **MegaETH**: Near-instant confirmations (~10ms blocks)
- **Base Sepolia**: ~2 second confirmations
- **Monad**: Variable confirmation times

## 🔧 Development Deployment

For local testing without contracts:
1. The game will work in "simulation mode"
2. Movements are logged but not sent to blockchain
3. All UI elements still function normally

## 🌟 Features Implemented

✅ **Transaction Queue System**: Handles rapid movements efficiently
✅ **Network Selection UI**: Switch between MegaETH, Base, and Monad
✅ **Real-time Status**: Shows pending transactions and network info
✅ **On-chain Scoring**: Persistent high scores on blockchain
✅ **Graceful Fallbacks**: Works even when contracts aren't deployed
✅ **Gas Optimization**: Minimal transaction costs

## 🎮 Gameplay

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the top-right wallet button
2. **Select Network**: Choose MegaETH for best experience
3. **Start Playing**: Each jump sends a blockchain transaction
4. **Experience Speed**: Feel the difference in block times!

## 📱 Mobile Support

The game is fully responsive and works on mobile devices with touch controls.

## 🔍 Monitoring

Watch the game UI for:
- **Network indicator**: Shows current blockchain
- **Movement counter**: Total on-chain movements
- **Pending transactions**: Queue status
- **On-chain score**: Blockchain-verified points

## 🎯 Similar to Crossy Fluffle

This implementation follows the same principles as the successful Crossy Fluffle game:
- Each movement is a transaction
- Max 2 pending transactions
- Real-time blockchain interaction
- Network speed comparison

## 🚦 Troubleshooting

**Game not connecting to blockchain?**
- Check wallet connection
- Ensure you're on a supported network
- Verify testnet funds availability

**Transactions failing?**
- Check gas fees
- Ensure contract is deployed on current network
- Verify wallet permissions

**Slow performance?**
- Switch to MegaETH for fastest experience
- Check network congestion
- Clear pending transactions if stuck
